# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a modular class booking system built with a focus on clean architecture, user experience, and performance. The system includes modules for user management, package handling, and course bookingâ€”with concurrency controls and session-aware authentication.

---

## Modules

### User Module

Handles user authentication, profile management, and secure multi-device support.

#### Features:
- **Registration & Login**: Users can register and log in using their credentials.
- **Logout with Multi-Device Support**: Logout supports `deviceId`-based session invalidation using Redis.
- **Change Password**: Users can securely update their passwords.
- **Reset Password**: Password reset functionality via secure token or email-based mechanism.
- **Profile View**: Users can view:
  - Account information
  - Purchased packages
  - Booked courses

---

### Package Module

Handles package display and purchase logic, with intelligent expiration handling.

#### Features:
- **View Packages**: All available packages are visible to users.
- **Purchase Package**: Users can purchase one or more packages.
- **Smart Expiry Handling**:
  - If a user purchases a **package of the same country**, the existing expiration date is **extended** instead of replaced.

---

### Course Module

Handles course booking, concurrency management, and waitlist processing.

#### Features:
- **Book Courses**:
  - Uses Redis to **check available slots** before hitting the database to ensure high performance and avoid overbooking.
  - Users **cannot book multiple courses at the same time slot**.
- **Cancel Booking**:
  - Users can **cancel within 4 hours** of booking.
  - Cancelled slots are **refunded**.
- **Waitlist Handling**:
  - If a slot becomes available (due to cancellation), a user from the **waitlist is auto-promoted** to a confirmed booking.

---

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot** (Core framework)
- **Redis** (Session handling, caching, and concurrency control)
- **JWT** (Authentication)
- **JPA/Hibernate** (Database ORM)
- **Docker** (Containerization for consistent deployment)

---

## Known Limitations (Time-Constrained)

Due to the one-day time constraint of the challenge, the following features were planned but not fully implemented:

- **Role-Based Authorization**: Currently, the system assumes all users have the same permissions.
- **Cache Invalidation**: No logic to invalidate Redis cache on updates (e.g., user profile or booking changes).

These would be next priorities in a production-ready system.
